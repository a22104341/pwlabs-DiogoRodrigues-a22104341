                Ulm is a university city, home to the tallest church building in the world. <br>This cities symbol is a
                sparrow.
                <br>
                The saying goes, that during the construction of the Ulm Cathedral, the workers had a problem carrying
                long
                beams through the narrow fortress gates.<br>
                Unlucky builders even gathered to destroy part of the defensive wall, but then one of them saw a sparrow
                carrying a small straw in its beak. <br>
                At the same time, he held it along, not across. <br>
                Rejoiced at the fact that the solution to the problem turned out to be so simple, local residents began
                to
                glorify the sparrow in every possible way and even erected several monuments in his honor.
