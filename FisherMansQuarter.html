    <h2>Fisherman's Quarter</h2>
    <p>
        The medieval district, built at the mouth of the river. Blau consists of traditional half-timbered houses,
        winding streets and numerous stone bridges. <br>Most of the buildings in the quarter are directly on the water,
        which is why Fishermen's Quarter is often compared to Italian Venice.
